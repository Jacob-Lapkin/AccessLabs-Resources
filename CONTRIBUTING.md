# Contributing to AccessLabs

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the AccessLabs Resource Repository\! We are thrilled you're here. This project is driven by a global community of scientists, educators, and innovators like you, and every contribution makes a difference.

This document provides a set of guidelines for contributing to our resources. Following these guidelines helps maintain the quality and clarity of our documentation and makes the contribution process smoother for everyone involved.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [AccessLabs Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report any unacceptable behavior.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, and all are valuable.

### Reporting Bugs & Issues

If you find a typo, a broken link, an error in a guide, or any other issue, please [open an issue](https://github.com/your-repo/accesslabs-resources/issues) in this repository.

When filing an issue, please provide a clear title and a detailed description of the problem. Include as much relevant information as possible, such as:

  - A link to the page where you found the issue.
  - A description of the problem.
  - A suggestion for how to fix it (if you have one).

### Suggesting Enhancements or New Content

Do you have an idea for a new guide, a scientific primer, or a useful addition to the glossary? We'd love to hear it\!

1.  **Check if the idea already exists:** Search the existing [issues](https://github.com/your-repo/accesslabs-resources/issues) to see if someone has already suggested your idea.
2.  **Create a new issue:** If your idea is new, please [open an issue](https://github.com/your-repo/accesslabs-resources/issues) and provide a clear description of your suggestion. Label it as a "content suggestion" or "enhancement."

### Submitting Changes via Pull Requests

If you are ready to contribute directly by adding or editing content, you can do so through a Pull Request (PR).

1.  **Fork the repository:** Create your own copy of the repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of this page.
2.  **Create a new branch:** In your forked repository, create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name, like `fix-typo-in-glossary` or `add-sds-page-guide`.
3.  **Make your changes:** Edit or add files in your branch.
4.  **Commit your changes:** Write a clear and concise commit message explaining what you've changed.
5.  **Push to your fork:** Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
6.  **Submit a Pull Request:** Open a pull request from your branch to our `main` branch. Provide a clear title and a detailed description of your changes. If your PR addresses an existing issue, please link to it in the description (e.g., "Fixes \#123").

## Pull Request Review Process

1.  Once you submit a pull request, the Open Bioeconomy Lab (OBL) Technical Team will be notified.
2.  A team member will review your changes for scientific accuracy, clarity, and formatting. They may leave comments or ask for modifications.
3.  Once the review is complete and any requested changes are made, your pull request will be merged. Your contribution will now be part of the official repository\!

We aim to review all pull requests within one week.

## Style Guides

To maintain consistency across the repository, please follow these simple style guides.

### Writing Style

  - **Tone:** Write in a clear, encouraging, and accessible tone. Avoid overly technical jargon where possible, and if you must use it, ensure the term is defined in our Glossary.
  - **Audience:** Remember that our audience is global and includes students, educators, and researchers with varying levels of experience.

### Markdown Formatting

  - Use standard Markdown for all text files.
  - Use headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) to structure your documents.
  - Use bullet points (`*` or `-`) for lists.
  - Use backticks (`` ` ``) for `inline code` or technical terms.

Thank you again for your interest in making biotechnology accessible to everyone\! ðŸŒ±
