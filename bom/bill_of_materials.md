| Item | Quantity | Cost (£) | Storage | Purpose | Justification of design | Component | Subcomponents |
|------|----------|----------|---------|---------|------------------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Magnetic rack** | | | Box | Magnetic beads protein purification | The rack geometry ensures clean handling during washes and elutions, and a low-cost, easily reproducible build, making it practical for resource-limited labs. 3D printing our own design was significantly cheaper than buying similar designs online | | |
| Magnets | 12 | 8.40 | | | | | |
| 3D Print Rack | 1 | 4.47 | | | | | |
| **Cool rack** | | | Box | To provide cooling reactions for cell transformations | The design was chosen because Koolpacks are cheap, reusable, and widely available, requiring no specialized equipment. They offer a compact and efficient alternative to ice, avoid the space and replenishment issues of ice storage, and reduce setup time, making them especially practical in labs without ice machines | | |
| 3D Print Rack | 1 | 6.76 | | | | | |
| Koolpack | 2 | 8.99 | | | | | |
| **Shaker** | | | Box | Shake liquid cultures during incubation, providing adequate oxygenation and promoting uniform growth. | At £51.98, the lab shaker is significantly cheaper than commercial models (£140+) and compact enough to fit inside the incubator. It includes a custom attachment compatible with both flasks and Eppendorf tubes, meeting the requirements of the provided protocols. Unlike other low-cost designs that use cheap motors and expensive electronics, we prioritized a robust motor (up to 400 RPM) for durability, while simplifying the electronics. A single motor speed controller board with a potentiometer, which includes a built-in switch, serves as the control interface | | |
| 3D Print Shaker Components | 1 | 13.25 | | | | | |
| Worm Gear Motor (12V) | 1 | 21.49 | | | | | |
| Motor Speed Controller | 1 | 2.50 | | | | | |
| Power Supply (12V 2A) | 1 | 9.29 | | | | | |
| Panel Mount | 1 | 0.90 | | | | | |
| Bearing | 6 | 4.55 | | | | | |
| **Incubator** | | | Box | Grow bacterial colonies on agar plates at controlled temperatures | At £69.01, the design is much cheaper than similarly sized low-cost commercial incubators (£140+). A pre-made acrylic box with built-in shelves is more economical than cutting acrylic from scratch, requiring only laser-cut openings for the sensor, heater, and shaker. Cable clips and a 3D-printed case manage and protect the electronics. The flat-pack walls can be self-assembled, making the design space-efficient for shipping. The integrated-fan heater outperforms cheaper alternatives like reptile mats. A temperature-sensing controller regulates heating, while the fan runs continuously to prevent heat pockets | | |
| Acrylic Display Case | 1 | 25.99 | | | | | |
| PTC Ceramic Fan Heater (12V 60W) | 1 | 20.56 | | | | | |
| Digital Temperature Controller | 1 | 7.91 | | | | | |
| Power Supply (12V 5A) | 1 | 8.49 | | | | | |
| Panel Mount | 1 | 0.90 | | | | | |
| Cable Clips, Screws, steel plate, aluminium rods | 1 | 3.99 | | | | | |
| 3D Print Electronics Case | 1 | 1.17 | | | | | |
| **Centrifuge** | 1 | 94.99 | Box | Grow bacterial colonies on agar plates at controlled temperatures | For robustness, we chose not to construct a custom 3D-printed centrifuge. Instead, we sourced an affordable, pre-assembled centrifuge compatible with Eppendorf tubes. | | |
| **Fluorometer (qByte)** | 1 | 60.00 | Box | Validate enzyme production and purification | Adopting low-cost fluorometer developed from the Open Bioeconomy Lab | | |
| **Handheld blender** | 1 | 15.00 | Box | Preparing water and emulsification | A handheld blender was selected for emulsification during microbead preparation. While custom designs were considered, commercial models proved highly affordable and readily available. Testing across multiple speed settings showed consistent performance, making the purchased blender a practical and reliable choice | | |
| **OD600 measuring device** | 1 | 185.00 | Box | Measure optical density for liquid induction phase | Due to time constraints, we opted not to develop a custom design for optical density measurements. Instead, we selected an existing low-cost, open-source solution available online | | |
